# Deep Learning Systems

**Primary reference:** 
[CMU 10-414/714: Deep Learning Systems](https://dlsyscourse.org/lectures/)
- Fall 2024
- Instructors: [J. Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com/) and [Tianqi Chen](https://tqchen.com/)

This course will provide you will an introduction to the functioning of modern deep
learning systems. You will learn about the underlying concepts of modern deep learning systems like
automatic differentiation, neural network architectures, optimization, and efficient
operations on systems like GPUs. 

Finally, to solidify understanding, the homeworks build
from scratch **needle** &mdash; a deep learning library loosely similar to PyTorch, and
implement many common architectures in the library.
